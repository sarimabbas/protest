# Funky

Augmented server-side edge/WinterCG functions.

## Description

I wrote Funky as a lighter weight alternative to existing projects (below). I also wanted to make sure that it worked with runtimes that specify WinterCG server function signatures e.g. Vercel's Edge runtime. Lastly, I wanted to automate the generation of OpenAPI schemas from Zod schemas.
